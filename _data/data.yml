career-profile:
    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      As a Biological Engineer with 6+ years of combined experience in the
      fields of molecular and computational biology, I offer suitable skillsets
      in a range of research fields including the medical field, neuroscience,
      genetics, cell biology, entomology, engineering, computer science, Linux
      system administration, and supercomputing.  While effective as an independent
      scientist, I have also found my enthusiasm for thorough research has inspired
      others to trust my management abilities.  These experiences have also given me
      the opportunity to take the lead on various academic and personal projects that
      define my career.

education:
    - degree: BS in Biomedical Engineering
      university: Mississippi State University
      time: 2008 - 2013

experiences:
    - role: Researcher II
      time: April 2015 - Present
      company: University of Mississippi Medical Center, Jackson, MS
      details: |
        As a Researcher II I worked in a molecular genetics lab focused on
        psychiatric disorderes in non-human primates.  Durring my time at UMMC,
        my primary role was the acting computational and molecular biologist.

          - Worked indirectly with rhesus monkeys to study the genetic underpinnings
          of psychiatric disorders including addiction, depression, impulsivity,
          suicidality, and other human behaviors using non-human primate models.
          - Developed and maintained projects, pipelines, and computing systems for
          phylogenetic, differential RNA expression, microbiome, and other bioinformatics
          research.
          - Isolation of large quantities of rhesus macaque DNA/RNA used in genotyping
          and gene expression assays including PCR, qPCR, RFLP, Sanger sequencing, and
          next-generation sequencing.
          - Provided support for stable cell line generation, transfection, transient
          transfection, transduction, pathway array plate assays, and ligand validation.

    - role: Lab Technician
      time: May 2013 - Jan 2015
      company: Mississippi State University, Starkville, MS
      details: |
        As a Lab Technician at MSU I was primarily tasked at processing entomological
        samples to further various research projects.

          - Established working knowledge of genetics, molecular biology, biochemistry,
          and wet lab techniques in a lab focused on invasive ant species.
          - Enhanced project management abilities under supervision from the principal
          investigator.

    - role: Engineering Technician
      time: May 2009 - Dec 2012
      company: Engineering Research and Development Center, Vicksburg, MS
      details: |
        As a student engineering intern I was given the opportunity to participate in real
        world engineering programs.

          - Supported the projects of world-class engineering mentors involved in land vehicle
          simulations, a physiological analysis of alligator gar scales, mechanical analysis of
          concrete, and chemical analysis of soil samples.
          - Gained valuable first hand insight into the scientific and engineering process.
